- Fetching all topics  
- Retrieving articles individually or as a list, including `comment_count`

## Getting Started Locally

Follow these steps to setup the project on your machine.

### âœ… 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hasnaindar8/nc-news-backend.git
cd nc-news-backend
```

### âœ… 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### âœ… 3. Setup environment variables

You must create **two** `.env` files in the project root:

```
.env.development
.env.test
```

Each file must contain a **PGDATABASE** variable with value of the correct local database as mentioned below:

```env
# .env.development
PGDATABASE=nc_news
```

```env
# .env.test
PGDATABASE=nc_news_test
```
These steps tell the app which database to connect to in different environments.

### âœ… 4. Setup local databases + seed

```bash
npm run setup-dbs
npm run seed
npm run test-seed
```

This creates both dev and test DBs with data.

### âœ… 5. Run Tests

 Jest + Supertest included.

```bash
npm test
```

Run a single test file:

```bash
npm test api
```

### âœ… 6. Start the server

```bash
npm run start
```

Server should be running at:

```
http://localhost:8080/getHealth
```
